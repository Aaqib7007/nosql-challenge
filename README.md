Challenge 12
This project uses MongoDB to manage data for establishments in the UK, focusing on hygiene scores and other restaurant attributes. 
It connects to the MongoDB server using pymongo and performs various queries such as filtering establishments by hygiene score, Local Authority, and RatingValue. 
The results are retrieved and processed using Python and Pandas to convert them into DataFrames for analysis. 
Aggregation pipelines are also used to group, sort, and analyze data based on specific conditions like hygiene scores and location.
